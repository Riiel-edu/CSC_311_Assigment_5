## Login Page

A page which allows one to login to an account using the database. The page does store the Lists based on the User but will not reject invalid users. The email and password to the test account are: johnemail@email.com and JOHN123

## Register Page

Allows you to create an account which can be used to store your custom lists within. Does not reject if the fields are not all filled.

## Landing Page

Allows for adding, editing and deleting files. The list will be tied to the user account that is used to login so changes will be saved. If no account is choosen errors will be thrown when using the features but they will still update locally.
